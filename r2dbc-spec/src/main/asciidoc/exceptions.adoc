[[exceptions]]
= Exceptions

This section explains how R2DBC uses and declares exceptions to provide information about various types of failures.

An exception is thrown by a driver when an error occurs during interaction with the driver or a data source.
R2DBC differentiates between generic and data-source-specific error cases.

[[exceptions.general]]
== General Exceptions

R2DBC defines the following general exceptions:

* <<exceptions.iae>>
* <<exceptions.iob>>
* <<exceptions.ise>>
* <<exceptions.nse>>
* <<exceptions.nsoe>>
* <<exceptions.uoe>>
* <<exceptions.r2e>>

[[exceptions.iae]]
=== `IllegalArgumentException`

Drivers throw `IllegalArgumentException` if a method has received an illegal or inappropriate argument (such as values that are invalid or an expected parameter is `null`).
This exception is a generic exception that is not associated with an error code or an `SQLState`.

[[exceptions.iob]]
=== `IndexOutOfBoundsException`

Drivers throw `IndexOutOfBoundsException` if a method has received an illegal or inappropriate index value (such as negative values or indexes that are greater or equal to the number of elements).
This exception is a generic exception that is not associated with an error code or an `SQLState`.

[[exceptions.ise]]
=== `IllegalStateException`

Drivers throw `IllegalStateException` if a method has received an argument that is invalid in the current state or when an argument-less method is invoked in a state that does not allow execution in the current state (such as interacting with a closed connection object).
This exception is a generic exception that is not associated with an error code or an `SQLState`.

[[exceptions.nse]]
=== `NoSuchElementException`

Drivers throw `NoSuchElementException` if a method has received a column/parameter name that doesn't exist in the collection of items.
This exception is a generic exception that is not associated with an error code or an `SQLState`.

[[exceptions.nsoe]]
=== `NoSuchOptionException`

R2DBC SPI throws `NoSuchOptionException` if a required `Option` is retrieved from `ConnectionFactoryOptions` that is either not configured or not associated with a value. `NoSuchOptionException` is a subclass of <<exceptions.ise>>.

[[exceptions.uoe]]
=== `UnsupportedOperationException`

Drivers throw `UnsupportedOperationException` if the driver does not support certain functionality (such as when a method implementation cannot be provided).
This exception is a generic exception that is not associated with an error code or an `SQLState`.

[[exceptions.r2e]]
=== `R2dbcException`

Drivers throw an instance of `R2dbcException` when an error occurs during an interaction with a data source.

The exception contains the following information:

* A textual description of the error.
You can retrieve the `String` that contains the description by invoking `R2dbcException.getMessage()`.
Drivers may provide a localized message variant.
* An `SQLState`.
The `String` that contains the `SQLState` can be retrieved by calling the `R2dbcException.getSqlState()` method.
The value of the `SQLState` string depends on the underlying data source.
* An error code.
The code is an integer value that identifies the error that caused the `R2dbcException` to be thrown.
Its value and meaning are implementation-specific and may be the actual error code returned by the underlying data source.
You can retrieve the error code by using the `R2dbcException.getErrorCode()` method.
* The offending SQL.
If a particular SQL statement results in an exception then you can can retrieve the SQL text using the `R2dbcException.getSql()` method.
* A cause.
This is another `Throwable` that caused this `R2dbcException` to occur.

[[exceptions.categorized]]
== Categorized Exceptions

Categorized exceptions provide a standard mapping to common error states. An R2DBC driver should provide specific subclasses to indicate affinity with the driver.
Categorized exceptions provide a standardized approach for R2DBC clients and R2DBC users to translate common exceptions into an application-specific state without the need to implement `SQLState`-based exception translation, resulting in more portable error-handling code.

R2DBC categorizes exceptions into two top-level categories:

* <<exceptions.categorized.non-transient>>
* <<exceptions.categorized.transient>>

[[exceptions.categorized.non-transient]]
=== Non-Transient Exceptions

A non-transient exception must extend the abstract class, `R2dbcNonTransientException`.
A non-transient exception is thrown when a retry of the same operation would fail unless the cause of the error is corrected.
After a non-transient exception other than `R2dbcNonTransientResourceException`, the application can assume that a connection is still valid.

R2DBC defines the following subclasses of non-transient exceptions:

* `R2dbcBadGrammarException`: Thrown when the SQL statement has a problem in its syntax.
* `R2dbcDataIntegrityViolationException`: Thrown when an attempt to insert or update data results in a violation of an integrity constraint.
* `R2dbcPermissionDeniedException`: Thrown when the underlying resource denied a permission to access a specific element, such as a specific database table.
* `R2dbcNonTransientException`: Thrown when a resource fails completely and the failure is permanent.
A connection may not be considered valid if this exception is thrown.

[[exceptions.categorized.transient]]
=== Transient Exceptions

A transient exception must extend the abstract class, `R2dbcTransientException`.
A transient exception is thrown when a previously failed operation might be able to succeed if the operation is retried without any intervention in application-level functionality.
After a non-transient exception other than `R2dbcTransientResourceException`, the application may assume that a connection is still valid.

* `R2dbcRollbackException`: Thrown when an attempt to commit a transaction resulted in an unexpected rollback due to deadlock or transaction serialization failures.
* `R2dbcTimeoutException`: Thrown when the timeout specified by a database operation (query, login, and so on) is exceeded.
This could have different causes (depending on the database API in use) but is most likely thrown after the database interrupts or stops the processing of a query before it has completed.
* `R2dbcNonTransientException`: Thrown when a resource fails temporarily and the operation can be retried.
A connection may not be considered valid if this exception is thrown.
